### Backend and provider

This project uses Google Cloud Platform as a cloud provide therefore, Google provider was used for terraform. As a backend was used `gcs` bucket.
```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    google = {
      version = "~> 3.83.0"
    }
  }
  
  backend "gcs" {
    credentials = "petclinic-app-94cd559f8bb4.json" # JSON file with credentials
    bucket      = "petclinic-tfstate"               # Bucket name
    prefix      = "terraform/state"                 # tfstate file location in GCS
  }
}
```
